The directory Degree3 currently contains data for the three types
of degree 3 conductor 1 L-functions.  The Gamma-types are
r0r0r0, r0r1r1, and rdeltac2kappa, and the filenames (and the
Mathematica list) in each file describe the type.

In types r0r0r0 and r0r1r1 each entry is of the form

`{{lambda1, lambda2}, {Re(a2), Im(a2), Re(a3), Im(a3), Re(a5), Im(a5),...}}`

In type rc the entries are

`{{kappa, lambda}, {Re(a2), Im(a2), Re(a3), Im(a3), Re(a5), Im(a5),...}}`

See the paper for the specific Gamma factors.

A better version of the data, indicating the accuracy of each number,
is being prepared.

Also in preparation is a better documented version of the code use to produce
the data.
